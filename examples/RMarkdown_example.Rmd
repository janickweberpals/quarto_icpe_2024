```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

new_users <- smdi::smdi_data_complete |> 
  dplyr::select(
    dplyr::ends_with("cat"), 
    dplyr::ends_with("num"),

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mean_age}
library(smdi)
library(gtsummary)

mean(new_users$age_num)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(new_users$age_num)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
